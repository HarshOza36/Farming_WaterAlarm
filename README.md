# Farming_WaterAlarm
An IOT solution for Farmers

There are alot of situations where a farmer has to use a water tank and supply water to the farm and keep monitoring the tank if it gets empty or not.

A solution to using Soil Moisture Sensor with UltraSonic Sensor.

We use a RasperryPi connected with these two sensors and run the FarmingIOTPro.py in raspberryPi to solve this issue.

Two things will happen when the tank is getting empty, One, Farmer will receive an email as a warning on his/her email address and second a buzzer will be connected to output of UltraSonic sensor which will be near the farmer, which will buzz as soon as ultrasonic sensor will find will the water is low in the tank.

This project was made in ATS Solutions Training in the domain of IOT with Machine Learning Using Python.
