# Farming_WaterAlarm
An IOT solution for Farmers

There are alot of situations where a farmer has to use a water tank and supply water to the farm and keep monitoring the tank if it gets empty or not.

A solution to using Soil Moisture Sensor with UltraSonic Sensor.

We use a RasperryPi connected with these two sensors and run the FarmingIOTPro.py in raspberryPi to solve this issue.
